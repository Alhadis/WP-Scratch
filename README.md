WP-Scratch
==========

Tabula rasa. Clean, blank slate for WordPress theme development.

## Usage

Develop static, flat HTML wireframes first, then drop the sliced components into
the relevant theme files. Because of this, no skeleton HTML is provided with the
basic page structures:  developers are assumed to have an intimate understanding
of WordPress when defining page elements such as menus, headers, sidebars, etc.
